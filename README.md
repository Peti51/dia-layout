This project is a website that incorporates various technologies to create an engaging and visually appealing user interface. The foundation of the website is built using HTML, providing the structure and content of the web pages. CSS is utilized to style the HTML elements, defining their appearance, layout, and formatting.

The project takes advantage of SCSS, a CSS preprocessor that enhances the styling capabilities by introducing features like variables, mixins, and nested rules. This allows for more efficient and modular CSS code.

To add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website, JavaScript is incorporated. JavaScript code is included in the <script> tags, enabling the implementation of interactive features, form validation, and other dynamic functionalities.

The website utilizes Google Fonts, providing a wide selection of fonts to enhance the visual appeal and typography of the text on the pages. Font Awesome is also integrated, offering a collection of scalable vector icons that can be customized and styled using CSS.

The inclusion of a favicon, a small icon displayed in the browser tab or bookmark bar, adds a distinctive visual identifier for the website.

The project references image files stored in a relative path, suggesting that it may be hosted on a version control platform like GitHub.

Overall, this project showcases a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with additional tools like SCSS, Google Fonts, Font Awesome, and a relative path for image files. These technologies work together to create an engaging and visually appealing website with interactive features and a polished user interface.
